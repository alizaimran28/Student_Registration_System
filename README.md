# Student_Registration_System
This C++ program is designed to manage a student registration system for a university. It utilizes functions, arrays, file handling, and basic user
input/output operations.
This C++ program is a basic simulation of a student registration system, specifically designed for a university context (here, UMT - University of Management and Technology). The program interacts with the user through the console and handles various functionalities related to student information, registration, fee defaulters, CGPA tracking, and prerequisite courses.
